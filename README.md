For this assignment I used google to refresh my memory on c++ syntax but I did not look up any answers or hints. I also worked very closely with Claresse from the second section. I had her look over a lot of my code and asked for her help with bugs.

IMPORTENT: My program does not work as intended. I poured hours into figuring out why I was getting segment fault errors and it only occured to me that if I swapped my two variables row Length and Col Length that it would work a half hour before the due date. I am confedient that my logic is correct for donut and mirror mode but I didn't have enough time to swap the two variables. Classic mode does work however. Reading from a file works perfectly and random generation definatly has some issues but is mostly there. I including a method to print to a file. I would have implemented it if I had more time, having to pack up and move was not something I was antisipating to do this week. Same goes for ossolation. I didn't have enough time to implement it. 

I know this isn't my strongest assignment and I will work hard in the future to make up for it.
